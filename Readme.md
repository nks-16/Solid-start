# SOLID Principles Coding Challenge

Welcome! This repo contains real-world problem statements designed to help you practice **SOLID design principles**.  

You can:
- Read the problem statements in the `Problem-Statement` folder.
- Implement your own clean solutions in the `Solutions` folder.

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Read** a problem statement from `Problem-Statement/`  
   Example: `ps-1.md`

2. **Create** a folder in `Solutions/` with:
   - Your GitHub username (or name)
   - `_`
   - Problem statement number  
   Example: `johnDoe_ps1`

3. **Inside your folder**, create:
level1/ → Step 1 solution
level2/ → Step 2 solution
level3/ → Step 3 solution


4. **Follow SOLID principles** in every level.

5. **Include a README.md in your folder** explaining:
- How your solution follows SOLID
- Design decisions you made
